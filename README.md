# Python Challenge

This repository contains my first Python Challenge homework assignment.

The second to last commit contained all of the code i came up with myself. The last commit was what my tutor helped me come up with. I did not get a chance to complete everything. The last commit does not allow the PyPoll to print the analysis properly, so I left what was printed for the prior commit.
